Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.
i. Commencing Arbitration. A party seeking arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to THE COMPANY, to you via any other method available to THE COMPANY, including via e-mail.

INDIAN INSTITUTE OF ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION (IIAM) WILL ADMINISTER ANY ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and IIAM forms are available at https://www.arbitrationindia.com/ If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against THE COMPANY, then THE COMPANY will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon THE COMPANY’s receipt of Notice at the Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt for the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than INR 50,000 or was filed in bad faith.

A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in New Delhi, will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and THE COMPANY agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
iii. No Class Actions. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THIS ENTIRE MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.
iv. Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this deadline by 30 days in the interests of justice. Arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all related records will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the award.

You agree that these terms and your use of the App evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
b. Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 15 do not apply to any claim in which THE COMPANY seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by THE COMPANY or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against THE COMPANY, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth above.
c. Claims. You and THE COMPANY agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
d. Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against THE COMPANY must be resolved in accordance with this Section 15. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 15 will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 15, THE COMPANY may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to INR 300,000, provided that THE COMPANY has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
e. Modifications. If THE COMPANY changes the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to THE COMPANY’s Address), then you may reject any such change by sending us written notice to THE COMPANY’s Address within 30 days of the change, in which case your Account and your right to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section 19, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive termination of this Agreement.
f. Enforceability. If only Section 15.a.iii or the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.

When you create a SLIMiot account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.

Purposes and legal Grounds:
(a) SLIMiot processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on SLIMiot’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
(b) SLIMiot also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your SLIMiot products, apps or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a SLIMiot website or app. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is SLIMiot’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your SLIMiot products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other SLIMiot users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from SLIMiot, SLIMiot will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about SLIMiot products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your SLIMiot account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from SLIMiot are based on the preferences you provide in your SLIMiot account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of SLIMiot devices you have added to your SLIMiot account, and any subscriptions included in your SLIMiot account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is SLIMiot’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.
(d) SLIMiot also processes your email address to associate it with your SLIMiot account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
Personal data that is processed when you sign in to your SLIMiot account with Social Media Credentials if you choose:
You may choose to sign in to your SLIMiot account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your Facebook sign in credentials). If you choose to do this, the first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to SLIMiot, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.
All of this information is made available to SLIMiot by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information SLIMiot retains and processes is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with SLIMiot by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your SLIMiot account using your SLIMiot account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.
Purposes and legal Grounds:
SLIMiot associates the email address provided by the social media provider with your SLIMiot account so that you can use your email address to sign in to your SLIMiot account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is SLIMiot’s legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign in method and in securing your account.
Personal data that is processed when you sync your SLIMiot device:
When you sync your device, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular) and device battery level.

When you interact with our customer support representatives via email, telephone, online or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences; and information about the SLIMiot products you own, such as their device ID and date of purchase. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives, and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your SLIMiot account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.

The legal ground for signing in to your SLIMiot account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is consent, which you may withdraw.

If you use a SLIMiot device or app and provide your consent, then SLIMiot will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording.

Categories of Recipients of Personal Data
Your friends invitees:
Friends is a feature available on some SLIMiot devices that enables you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device. Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your SLIMiot device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your SLIMiot device.

SLIMiot uses cloud services from third parties to assist in sending emails. Those services track the activities associated with these emails, such as whether they were opened, whether links in the emails were clicked on, and whether purchases were made following clicks on those links.
